// pathlock is used to prevent two PutFile calls that affect the same path (e.g.
// Put("/foo") and Delete("/")) from racing. The rule is: before running any
// PutFile operation B, make sure there is no running PutFile operation A such
// that B.Path is a prefix of A.Path or vice-versa.
//
// Note that pathlock can only block one goro at a time. This works for PutFile
// (where requests are arriving in a stream, and the whole stream stream can be
// paused until conflicting paths are finished), but you could not use this to
// schedule N goroutines and have each independently call start() (i.e. many
// goros blocking at once). Not only would it be complicated to track which
// goros are blocked on what, this use-case would introduce complicated
// fairness/livelock issues that pathlock doesn't attempt to solve.

// [1] lub ("least upper bound") is the smallest entry in 'running' that is
// greater than or equal to 'path'. This code depends on the fact that if there
// is a P in 'running' such that 'path' is a prefix of P, then 'path' must be a
// prefix of 'running[lub]'. Proof:
//
// Let i be the smallest int such that 'path' is a prefix of running[i]. Then,
// we know 'path' <= running[i] (b/c it's a prefix), and therefore lub <= i (by
// the definition of lub). Thus, path <= running[lub] <= running[i] and because
// 'path' is a prefix of running[i], 'path' must be a prefix of running[lub] as
// well (if any letter was different, it would place running[lub] either before
// 'path' or after 'running[i]').
//
// [2] To see that the loop invariant 'path[:i+1] <= running[lub]' is
// maintained, we need to show that
//   lub' = SearchStrings(running[:lub], path[:i]) = lub of path[:i] in running
// yields the least upper bound of path[:i] in running. To see that, observe:
//   path[:i] < path[:i+1] <= running[lub] <= running[lub+1:]...
//   --> SearchStrings(running[:lub], path[:i])
//         = 1. lub of path[:i] in running[:lub], if any values in running[:lub]
//              are >= path[:i], or
//           2. lub, if everything in running[:lub] is < path[:i]
//         = smallest value in 'running' that is >= path[:i]
